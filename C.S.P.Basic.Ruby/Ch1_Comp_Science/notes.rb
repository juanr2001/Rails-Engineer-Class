-Computer Science is never tied to a programming language: it is tied to the task of solving problems efficiently using a computer.
-Coputer Science's core goal is to to study alogorithms that solves real problems.
-Pceducode specifies the logical, conceptual steps the must occur without specifying in detail each step to actually execute each step
           -----Problem solving steps--------
           Problem - To store name in a list
     => 1) Understand the problem- know all the details of the problem. (How many)(First and last name store separetly)(Middle names needed)(Maximum length))))
     => 2) Write out the solution in plain language- Outline how will you solve it.
     => 3) Translate the language into code.
     => 4) Test the code in the computer.

#Example 1-1
# puts "Enter your first name"
# answer = gets.chomp
# puts "Enter your middle name"
# answer1 = gets.chomp
# puts "Enter your last name"
# answer2 = gets.chomp

# puts "My name is #{answer} #{answer1} #{answer2}"

-Alogorith does not need to every single ditail, but it needs to have all important parts.
-Just because I created a good alogorithm does not make it efficient and being able to fix  an existing/new alogorith to make it efficient,
    is what distiguishes a good developer.
-!!!!!   The COMPUTER IS NEVER WRONG   !!!!!!  It's just following the derections we have given it.
